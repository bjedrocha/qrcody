## QRCody - QRCode Microservice

QRCody is a very small [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) application that provides on-the-fly [QR Code](http://www.qrcode.com/en/) generation with built-in caching. I needed an alternative to Google's depracated and soon to be gone [Infographics API](https://developers.google.com/chart/infographics/docs/qr_codes) so I decided to write my own.
